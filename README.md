# versatile-portfolio

Create a personal portfolio website for a multifaceted individual with expertise in medical studies, machine learning engineering, and entrepreneurship. The website should have a sleek, modern design with a dark background, shades of green for highlights, and white text for readability. It should include intuitive layout with smooth animations, sections for Bio, Publications with interactive elements, a Photography gallery, Innovation Projects with detailed descriptions and visuals, a CV and Contact section with download and social media links, and a contact form. Additional features include responsiveness, SEO optimization, and possibly a blog. Use React.js with Framer Motion for development to ensure support for animations and interactivity, prioritize loading speed and optimization, and implement accessibility features.
